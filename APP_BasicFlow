Advantages of using three-tier architecture:
It makes the logical separation between business layer and presentation layer and database layer.
Migration to new graphical environments is faster.
As each tier is independent it is possible to enable parallel development of each tier by using different sets of developers.
Easy to maintain and understand large project and complex project.
Since application layer is between the database layer and presentation layer so the database layer will be more secured and client will not have direct access to the database.

Disadvantage of using three-tier architecture:
To implement even small part of application it will consume lots of time.
Need good expertise in object oriented concept (classes and objects).
It is more complex to build.

Basic Flow of the thre-tier architecture :

(1) Inserting/Updating/deleting a record from database through the app
